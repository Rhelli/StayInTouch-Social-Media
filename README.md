## üî∞ The Project Brief

This is a project included in the Rails module to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/).

This project sees us tackle a larger, more complex and realistic task in creating a social media web app with all the functionality we've come to expect from social media websites - friendships, invites, posts, comments and likes.

As this project naturally has a larger remit than previous back-end centric projects that have come before, it is split up into <u>5 major milestones</u>:
 1. Data Architecture & Planning
 2. Creation of friendship models & associations
 3. Improving efficiency of mutual friendship generation & handling
 4. Deployment to Heroku
 5. Final Touches & Styling

## üîç The Nitty Gritty
Posts, comments and likes had been handled for us in the project setup, thus the core challenges in this project were establishing an efficient friendship system whereby users could send invitations as well as receive invitations, all while maintaining a tidy database.

This enforced some ground rules as to how we should generated our models:
 - Users would have to have friendships as well as inverse friendships (where they are the friend of another)
 - Friendships would have to belong to users both as the creator of the friend request and also the receiver.

Subsequently, an additional medley of controller and helper functions would enable detection of friend request states and existence, enable creation and destruction of requests and allow for updating on friend request acceptance or decline.

## üî¨ Tools & Technology Used
**Languages & Frameworks**
 - Ruby 2.7.1
 - Ruby on Rails 6.0.3.1
 - SASS/CSS3

**Gems of note**
 - [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise)
 - [Faker](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker)
 - [HIRB](https://github.com/cldwalker/hirb)  (MVP Award ü•á)

**Testing**
 - [RSpec 3.9](https://rspec.info/)

**Database**
 - PostgreSQL

**Linters & Quality Control**
 - [Stickler CI](https://stickler-ci.com/)
 - [Rubocop 0.85.0](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop-rails)

**Deployment**
 - Heroku

### üíª Setup & Use

#### Setup
Setup should be fairly straightforward. You will have to ensure your machine is properly equipped to run the code first:
  1. Make sure you have both [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and Ruby on Rails ([Mac](https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.15-catalina) ‚Ä¢ [Linux](https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/19.10) ‚Ä¢ [Windows](https://gorails.com/setup/windows/10)) installed.
  2. Download this repository.
  3. **`cd`** into the root directory of wherever you download this repo. [What does 'cd' mean?](https://www.macworld.com/article/2042378/master-the-command-line-navigating-files-and-folders.html)
  4. Whilst at the root (home) directory of this project, enter **`bundle install`** to install the projects software dependencies.
  5. In your terminal window, enter **`rails server`** to start the server.
  6. Now navigate to **`localhost:4000`** in your browser to start playing around with the webpages!

Alternatively if you'd like to confirm the entire project is passing testing:
  1. **`cd`** into this repository in your terminal
  2. Enter **`bundle exec rspec`** to run all tests

### Prompting and Encouraging Users To Post


<a href="previews/new-post-title.gif"><img src="previews/new-post-title.gif" alt="Randomised Post Title" width="800" height="auto"></a>
